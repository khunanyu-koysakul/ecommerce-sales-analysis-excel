# E-Commerce Sales Analysis (Excel)

## Overview
This project analyzes an e-commerce sales dataset using Microsoft Excel to understand sales performance, customer purchasing behavior, and product contribution to revenue.  
The goal is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights that can support decision-making and improve profitability.

## Tools
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Basic Data Visualization

## Analysis Performed
- Monthly sales and profit trend analysis
- Order volume and quantity trend
- Top performing products identification
- Revenue contribution by category
- Profit margin comparison
- Customer purchasing behavior patterns

## Key Insights
- Sales and order volume increase significantly toward the end of the year, suggesting strong seasonal demand.
- A small number of products generate a large portion of total revenue, indicating a concentration of sales performance.
- Some high-revenue products have relatively low profit margins, reducing overall profitability.
- Order volume growth does not always translate to proportional profit growth, implying pricing or cost inefficiencies.
- Profit margin fluctuates monthly, showing inconsistent cost control or discount strategies.

## Business Implications
The business is highly dependent on peak-season demand and a limited set of products.  
Without optimization, revenue growth alone may not maximize profit due to margin inefficiencies.

## Action Plan
- Focus marketing campaigns on top-performing products during high-demand months
- Improve pricing strategy for low-margin high-volume items
- Bundle slow-moving products with best sellers to increase basket value
- Prepare inventory in advance for peak seasonal periods
- Monitor discount usage to stabilize profit margins

## Result
The analysis provides clear direction on which products to prioritize, how to adjust pricing strategies, and how to better prepare for seasonal demand, enabling more data-driven business decisions.
